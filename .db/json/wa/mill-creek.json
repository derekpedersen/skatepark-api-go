I grew up in Mill Creek but unfortunately this park wasn't built until 2004 and by that point I was about to graduate from high school and had stopped actively skating. When I first rode this bowl in the summer of 2007 I had just got back into skating and had only been riding a 2.5 foot mini-ramp I built in my backyard so I wasn't able to fully appreciate this bowl. Then in the summer of 2017 I really got back into skating and was able to appreciate it.",
