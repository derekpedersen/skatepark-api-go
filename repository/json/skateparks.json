        "description": "The bowl at this park is on a whole other level. The concrete is super smooth and you can really fly around it. It was my first time on real pool ledge and since I had only been back on a skateboard for all of 3 months after an 8 year hiatus I wasn't able to do much. But man was this thing fun to ride. I was there on a Friday afternoon and it was completely empty. Came back on Sunday on the way home at around noon and it was packed full people on the upper deck with about 5 or so riding the shallow end of the bowl.",

When I first rode this bowl in the summer of 2007 I had just got back into skating and had only been riding a 2.5 foot mini-ramp I built in my backyard so I wasn't able to fully appreciate this bowl. Then in the summer of 2017 I really got back into skating and was able to appreciate it.",
